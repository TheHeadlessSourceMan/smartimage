This is a great example for smartimage

But first we want to write a gimp import/export tool.
There are some links here to gimp plugins
Don't forget to use the menu help->procedure_browser and help->plug_in_browser
also i put a link to the plugins dir

TODO: installer does not work due to friggin windows permissions.
	You have to manually make the plugins dir writeable, which sucks!
